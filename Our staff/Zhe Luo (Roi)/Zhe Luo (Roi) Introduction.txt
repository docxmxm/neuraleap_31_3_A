With over five years of experience in educational history, including three years as an AI tutor at UTS, I am currently in the final year of my PhD in Artificial Intelligence. As a co-founder of two AI startups, I have developed a strong passion for the intersection of technology, business, and real-world applications. I firmly believe that AI has the potential to enhance peopleâ€™s lives and improve how we work, rather than simply replacing jobs.
